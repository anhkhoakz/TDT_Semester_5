# My Project

This is a sample project that demonstrates the organization of code into different layers: Business Logic Layer (BLL), Data Access Layer (DAL), and Data Transfer Object (DTO).

## Business Logic Layer (BLL)

The business logic layer contains the `BusinessLogic` class, which encapsulates the operations and rules related to the business domain. It is defined in the file `src/BLL/BusinessLogic.cs`. This class may include methods for processing data, performing calculations, and implementing business rules.

## Data Access Layer (DAL)

The data access layer contains the `DataAccess` class, which handles the interaction with the data storage. It is defined in the file `src/DAL/DataAccess.cs`. This class may include methods for querying, inserting, updating, and deleting data.

## Data Transfer Object (DTO)

The data transfer object layer contains the `DataTransferObject` class, which represents a structured data object that can be passed between the BLL and DAL layers. It is defined in the file `src/DTO/DataTransferObject.cs`. This class typically includes properties that mirror the structure of the data being transferred.

## Other Files

- `tsconfig.json`: This file is the configuration file for TypeScript. It specifies the compiler options and the files to include in the compilation.
- `package.json`: This file is the configuration file for npm. It lists the dependencies and scripts for the project.
